# LiveProjectSnippets
Code snippets from my completed tickets on a two week live project sprint.

•	Constructed an ASP.NET Code First Entity Framework using MVC. Designed and built models for a code first database along with controller actions, views, and front/back-end validation. 
•	Generated default users and roles for the database, and implemented authorization on the user interfaces and controller actions. 
•	Utilized Scrum team management methodology using Microsoft Team Foundation Server, and lead as Scrum master during the design and build phases of a live project application.
